# PowerClient
This is a simple client checking the Live-In Smartgrid API if there is a peak in the power demand

It's using micropython on an ESP8266 to read out the power status
and showing a simple graph of the history of the powertrend.

The calls can easily be changed to instead control different processes
and local GPIO's feel free to invent.
